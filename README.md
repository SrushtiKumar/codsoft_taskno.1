## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

<h1>THE NUMBER GAME</h1>
<br>
<p>
1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.<br>
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.<br>
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.<br>
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.<br>
You can incorporate additional details as follows:<br>
5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.<br>
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.<br>
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.<br>
